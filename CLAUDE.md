## Code Guidelines

- Always use Annotated fields from the typing library in mcp tool functions
- Always commit changes in feature branches containing the human's git user
- Use the @Makefile commands for local linting, formatting, and testing
- Always update the __init__.py when adding new files in prompts, resources, or tools
