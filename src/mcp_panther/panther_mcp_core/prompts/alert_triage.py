1. Get all alert IDs between {start_date} and {end_date}.
2. Get stats on all alert events with the get_alert_event_summaries tool.
3. Group alerts by entity names, combining similar alerts together.
4. For each group:
    1. Identify the common entity name performing the actions
    2. Summarize the activity pattern across all related alerts
    3. Include key details such as:
    - Rule IDs triggered
    - Timeframes of activity
    - Source IPs and usernames involved
    - Systems or platforms affected
    4. Provide a brief assessment of whether the activity appears to be:
    - Expected system behavior
    - Legitimate user activity
    - Suspicious or concerning behavior requiring investigation
    5. End with prioritized recommendations for investigation based on the entity groups, not just alert severity.

Format your response with clear markdown headings for each entity group and use concise, cybersecurity-nuanced language."""
