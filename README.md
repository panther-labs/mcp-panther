[![Ruff](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astral-sh/ruff/main/assets/badge/v2.json)](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)

This Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Panther provides functionality to:
1. Write and tune detections natively in Cursor or Goose with real data
2. Interactively query security logs in your security data lake using natural language
3. Triage, comment, and resolve Panther alerts using a conversational interface

## Security Best Practices

As a security company, we highly recommend that you follow the best practices below:

- **Run only trusted, officially signed MCP servers.** Verify digital signatures or checksums before running, audit the tool code, and avoid community tools that have not passed any security review or are not from an official publisher.
- **Apply strict least-privilege to every API credential (e.g., Panther API tokens).** Scope tokens to the minimal permissions required and bind them to an IP allow-list or CIDR range so they're useless if exfiltrated. Rotate credentials on a preferred interval (e.g., every 30d).
- **Host the MCP server in a locked-down sandbox (e.g., Docker) with read-only mounts.** This confines any compromise to a minimal blast radius.
- **Monitor credential access to Panther and monitor for anomalies.** Write a Panther rule!
- **Scan MCP servers with `mcp-scan`.** Utilize the `mcp-scan` tool by [invariantlabs](https://github.com/invariantlabs-ai/mcp-scan) for common vulnerabilities.

> Note: There is a lack of support for secure credential management with MCP clients today. We anticipate that to change and will update this section once it does.

## Setup

Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:panther-labs/mcp-panther.git
```

## Installation Options

### Option 1: Docker Setup (Recommended)
1. Ensure Docker is installed on your system
2. Build the Docker image:
```bash
make build-docker
```
3. Configure your MCP client of choice:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-panther": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "-e", "PANTHER_INSTANCE_URL",
        "-e", "PANTHER_API_TOKEN",
        "--rm",
        "mcp-panther"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PANTHER_INSTANCE_URL": "https://YOUR-PANTHER-INSTANCE.domain",
        "PANTHER_API_TOKEN": "YOUR-API-KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 2: UV Setup
1. Ensure Python 3.12 is installed:
```bash
pyenv install 3.12  # if using pyenv
```

2. [Install UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

3. Create virtual environment and install dependencies:
```bash
# On Unix/macOS
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync  # This will install all dependencies from requirements.txt with exact versions

# On Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
uv sync
```

4. Configure your MCP client of choice:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-panther": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with",
        "aiohttp",
        "--with",
        "gql[aiohttp]",
        "--with",
        "mcp[cli]",
        "mcp",
        "run",
        "PATH-TO-LOCAL-MCP-SERVERS/mcp-panther/src/mcp_panther/server.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PANTHER_INSTANCE_URL": "https://YOUR-PANTHER-INSTANCE.domain",
        "PANTHER_API_TOKEN": "YOUR-PANTHER-API-TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Panther API Configuration

After installation, you'll need to configure your Panther API access:

1. Create an API token in Panther:
   - Navigate to Settings (gear icon) â†’ API Tokens
   - Create a new token with the following permissions (recommended read-only approach):

![Alt text](panther-token-perms-1.png)
![Alt text](panther-token-perms-2.png)

2. Store the generated token securely (e.g., in 1Password)

3. Update your MCP configuration:
   - Replace `YOUR-PANTHER-INSTANCE.domain` with your Panther instance URL
   - Replace `YOUR-API-TOKEN` with your generated API token

## Usage

Once installed and configured, you can use MCP-Panther in several ways:

### Cursor
[Follow the instructions here](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#configuring-mcp-servers) to configure your project or global MCP configuration. **It's VERY IMPORTANT that you do not check this file into version control.**

### Claude Desktop App
Install the server directly:
```bash
uv run mcp install src/mcp_panther/server.py
```

If you run into any issues, [try the troubleshooting steps here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user#troubleshooting).

### Goose
Use with [Goose](https://block.github.io/goose/), Block's open-source AI agent:
```bash
# Install the package with entry points
uv pip install .

# Start Goose with the MCP server
goose session --with-extension "uv run /path/to/mcp-panther/.venv/bin/mcp-panther"
```
> NOTE: Adjust the path to match your installation directory

## Troubleshooting

Check the server logs for detailed error messages: `tail -n 20 -F ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log`. Common issues and solutions are listed below.

### Initializing mcp-panther

- If you see an error like `typer is required`, make sure you've installed MCP with CLI components: `pip install mcp[cli]`
- Ensure the `npm` and `uv` are installed **globally** on your system.

### Running tools

- If you get a `{"success": false, "message": "Failed to [action]: Request failed (HTTP 403): {\"error\": \"forbidden\"}"}` error, it likely means your API token lacks the particular permission needed by the tool.
- Ensure your Panther Instance URL is correctly set. You can view this in the `config://panther` resource from your MCP Client.
