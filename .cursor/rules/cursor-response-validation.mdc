      Before suggesting a solution:
      - Verify syntax and compilation
      - Check for potential runtime errors
      - Test the change with example inputs
      - Verify integration points
      - Check for side effects
      - Ensure backward compatibility
      - Validate against existing tests
      
      Document verification steps:
      1. What was tested
      2. How it was tested
      3. Expected outcomes
      4. Edge cases considered
      5. Potential limitations
      6. Mermaid graph illustrations if applicable

      Better: "Here's the fix for the authentication bug. I've verified it by:
      1. Testing with valid and invalid credentials
      2. Checking session handling edge cases
      3. Verifying it works with existing middleware
      4. Confirming backward compatibility
      5. Running existing auth test suite
      
      The solution handles these cases: ..."

      Better: "I've updated the API endpoint and verified:
      1. All CRUD operations work as expected
      2. Error responses are correct
      3. Rate limiting still functions
      4. Authentication flow is preserved
      5. Existing clients won't break
