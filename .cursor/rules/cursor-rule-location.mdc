      When creating Cursor rules:

      1. Always place rule files in PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/:
         ```
         .cursor/rules/
         ├── your-rule-name.mdc
         ├── another-rule.mdc
         └── ...
         ```

      2. Follow the naming convention:
         - Use kebab-case for filenames
         - Always use .mdc extension
         - Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose
         - Follow the namespaced file schema:
           - For rules within the cursor-rules repository: <software>-<category>-<specifics>.mdc
           - For rules in other repositories: <repository>-<software>-<category>-<specifics>.mdc
           - Only include category and specifics where they provide meaningful context
           - Example: typescript-formatting.mdc, github-actions-security.mdc

      3. Directory structure:
         ```
         PROJECT_ROOT/
         ├── .cursor/
         │   └── rules/
         │       ├── your-rule-name.mdc
         │       └── ...
         └── ...
         ```

      4. Never place rule files:
         - In the project root
         - In subdirectories outside .cursor/rules
         - In any other location

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Rule file in wrong location
      rules/my-rule.mdc
      my-rule.mdc
      .rules/my-rule.mdc

      # Good: Rule file in correct location
      .cursor/rules/my-rule.mdc
      
      # Good: Rule file with proper naming schema
      # In cursor-rules repository
      .cursor/rules/typescript-formatting.mdc
      .cursor/rules/python-testing.mdc
      
      # In other repositories
      .cursor/rules/cursor-typescript-formatting.mdc
      .cursor/rules/github-actions-security.mdc
      .cursor/rules/aws-lambda-logging.mdc
    output: "Correctly placed and named Cursor rule file"
