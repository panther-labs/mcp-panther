      When writing Cursor rules, follow these key principles:

      1. Rule Structure
         - Every rule must have a clear description, following the header schema of Cursor Rules
         - Use descriptive names that indicate the rule's function
         - Include relevant filters to target specific files/events
         - Provide clear, actionable messages

      2. Documentation
         - Start with a high-level overview
         - Include examples of both correct and incorrect usage
         - Document any assumptions or prerequisites
         - Explain the reasoning behind the rule

      3. Examples
         - Provide multiple examples covering different scenarios
         - Include both positive and negative cases
         - Make examples concrete and realistic
         - Comment examples to explain key points

      4. Testing
         - Include test cases in the examples section
         - Verify rule triggers appropriately
         - Test edge cases and common variations
         - Ensure error messages are helpful

      5. Maintenance
         - Version your rules
         - Include metadata for priority and status
         - Document dependencies between rules
         - Plan for future updates
